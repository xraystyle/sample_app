# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

This is my implementation of this RoR tutorial from Michael Hartl.

During the process of completing this tutorial I've made a number of tweaks and additions to the example code given on the website. I've completed most if not all of the chapter exercises, as well as added a decent amout of further test coverage that wasn't in the original examples.

Also, I've implemented unique usernames and Twitter "@" style username mentions. All of this functionality was implemented via TDD, with the Rspec tests being written prior to the implementation. Test coverage for this new functionality is fairly good as well.
