Implement @ replies.

Needed:

Users will require a unique username.

Username format: a-z0-9, -, _, all lowercase.
	
	Users table will need a new column for the username, unique: true -- Added.
	-- currently modifying user spec tests for username functionality. -- Done.
	Add it to all the Factory Girl generators --Done
	Add to db:populate rake task --Done

	Add it to the signup/sign-in/account edit pages. --Done.
	Also added to user profile page, and user list page. 
	Still need usernames to appear next to posts in feed, which needs test coverage.

Microposts model:

	Finding an @:
	regex should check for start of string, '@' sign, then keep matching until an invalid username char is hit.
	regex: @([A-Za-z0-9_-]+) 
	@usernames will be matched, match groups will contain just the username. Downcase it and use it to find the mentioned user.
	
	Will need an in_reply_to column
	including_replies scope is recommended.

	!!! Multiple mentions per micropost are possible. Having a single in_reply_to column doesn't cut it.
	A join table is needed, something like:

	 MICROPOST_REPLIES_TABLE
	-------------------------
	 micropost_id | user_id
	--------------|----------
	       5      |    2
	--------------|----------
	       7      |    13 
	--------------|----------
	       7      |    9


 Checking the post content for mentions should be a before_save callback in the Micropost model. Don't fuck with the controller.
